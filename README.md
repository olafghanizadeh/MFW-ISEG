# MFW-ISEG
This repo contains a LaTeX template for the master thesis @ ISEG

The template is based on work done by Professor [Paulo Brito](https://github.com/pmbbrito) and Domingos Seward.

## Motivation
By making the template available on Github it will be easy for anyone to find and to improve it.


## Goals
- Refactor into a class in order to remove layout logic from thesis content
- Compatability with Pandoc and Rmarkdown

## Issues
